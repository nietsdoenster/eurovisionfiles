In my programming code, I computated statistics of the Eurovision Songcontest.

Initially I started out with Pyparsing. At first, I did a short testround with greetings to show some different aspects
of Pyparsing. Then, I used Pyparsing to print the results of the Eurovision in a pretty context. I wanted to do more
with Pyparsing, but after that I mainly focussed on getting the statistics and found out that Pyparsing wasn't a
usefool tool to do that. However, Pyparsing can be very useful as a tool to quickly parse results and printing data in a
pretty fashion. 

In the rest of the file, I calculated lots of different things: most successful country in the 21st century based on
scores (total amount of points given to a country between the years 2000-2016), the least succesful countries in the
21st century, the total ranking of the countries based on popularity, the number ánd percentage of West-European countries
/ Scandinavian Countries / Slavic countries, et cetera that have attended the contest, the most successful country based 
on how many times x country has won the Eurovision Song Contest, the most successful gender / group formation among the 
winners and the total number of winners (it's not what you think!) and the number of times each country was in the finals
in the 21st century. 

Lastly, I used some new tools, like itertools and collections. 

Hopefully, it will be an interesting read for outsiders, with some unexpected results!
